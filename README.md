## Deploying on Render

This repository uses public Git submodules for the backend, frontend, and shared packages. Commit the submodule entries and `render.yaml` to the repository, then create a Blueprint in Render from the repository. Render will create the PostgreSQL database, build the NestJS API, and publish the Vite frontend.

1. Push this branch, including the submodule entries, to GitHub.
2. In Render, choose **New > Blueprint** and select the GitHub repository and branch.
3. Enter every value requested for the `sync: false` environment variables. Use the API service URL for `VITE_BACKEND_URL` and include the frontend URL in `VITE_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`.
4. Apply the Blueprint and wait for the database, API, and frontend services to deploy.
5. Run Prisma migrations or seed data from the API service shell as needed. The first deployment only generates the Prisma client; it does not modify database data.

The API uses Render's `PORT` through `SERVER_PORT`. Keep the database URL generated by the Blueprint as `SERVER_DATABASE_URL`; Prisma expects that exact variable name.

The above README is a work in progress and will be updated with previews as well as other information as we get closer to a release ready state for Blacket V3. Feel free to make a PR to improve this README with some writeups, etc.
